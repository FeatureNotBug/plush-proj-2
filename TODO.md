# TODO List
## Less ambitious plan that may take out the mailboxer altogether:
- Communications are not based on the site (just links people together)
- User profile links to request form:
    - Info on request form is formatted to be sent out to user's email (not in PM system)
        - PM system may still be okay.

This means that the site is for:
- connecting users
- displaying crafts
- price comparison (how would one logically make sure results are accurate?)

Add tabs to User edit page: (will have to go into devise's stuff, right? ugh)
- profile edit
    - logistics?
    - gallery

Also needed:
- User search
- User sort (by price?  Need to think of how to calculate that)
- review system

Things to consider:
- HUGE PROBLEMS WITH ADD NEW LINK! (turbolinks issues, but disabling that will be bad for my other things, esp recipients field)
- Forums? (Have to figure out how to set that up...)
- clean up bugs; 
  - why is the highlighting wonky?  
  - turbolinks
- user avatars
