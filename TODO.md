# TODO List
## Less ambitious plan that may take out the mailboxer altogether:
- Communications are not based on the site (just links people together)
- User profile links to request form:
    - Info on request form is formatted to be sent out to user's email (not in PM system)

This means that the site is for:
- connecting users
- displaying crafts
- price comparison (how would one logically make sure results are accurate?)
